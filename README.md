# Cpu_scheduling-algorithms
Contains different cpu scheduling algorithms like FCFS, RR, SRT, SJF and their analysis
simulated the scheduling algorithms like  FCFS, RR, SRT, SJF  and evaluated their performance (throughput, latency, utilization, turnaround time, and waiting time) in a multi-processor environment.
